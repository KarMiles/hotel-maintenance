#### Overview
The Hotel Maintenance System (HMS) is designed for efficient and timely management of issues arrising around a property. It's main focus is the use in hotels, motels, bed & breakfasts, youth hostels and other kinds of establishments in the hospitality business. It enables staff of different departments, most notably the Front Desk / Reception and Maintenance Team, to report, check status and close tickets with break-downs and upgrades around the hotel.

#### Using HMS
It is necessary to follow instructions shown on the screen to be able to proceed with the program. E.g. to choose option 1 an actual digit 1 needs to be entered from the keyboard in the place indicated, not clicking the option or writing words describing the option.
Whenever entry is limited to a number of options (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4) or need to be keyed in in a specific format (e.g. room number) this input is validated and accepted only when requirements are met. 

#### Login
Upon starting HMS you need to enter correct login and password. These may be issued by the administrator of the program.

#### Main Menu
After correctly logging in you are presented with the following options:

##### 1 - Report new issue.
Selecting this options will let you submit a new maintenance ticket. This is done by answering four questions about details of the issue: room number (or "000" for other areas), issue urgency, brief description, and nature of the issue (mechanical, electrical etc.). After answering those questions you may submit the ticket or abandon the operation. When a new ticket is submitted, it is immediately available for viewing by other users and email with details of the ticket is sent to the inbox of a member of the Maintenance Team. 

After submitting the new ticket confirmation about successful operation is displayed together with the summary of tickets related to the room affected. 

##### 2 - Enquire about a room.
Choosing this option lets you see all tickets currently related with a specific room. Only actual (open) tickets are presented here. If you need to see all tickets, including the closed ones, they may be accessed by choosing option 4 - See all maintenance tickets.

After entering the room number a table with all current tickets is presented. 

##### 3 - Close ticket.
The purpose of this option is changing the status of a maintenance ticket from open to close. After closing a ticket it no longer shows in queries about a room in option 2. This also provides members of the Maintenance Team with information that no more actions are required related to a specific issue. 

To close a ticket its unique number (ticket id) is required. If you do not know the ticket id, you may find it via option 4 - See all maintenance tickets, where all tickets are presented, both open and closed.

After successfully closing a ticket a confirmation is shown together with details of the ticket.

##### 4 - See all maintenance tickets.
Purpose of this option is displaying all tickets that are present in the system, both open and closed. This is for the reference in case information is needed on history of any room or for other reasons.

Together with the table containing the tickets a brief summary is presented with total number of tickets and breakdown according to kinds of issues.

##### Return to the Main Menu
Every sequence ends with a question if you want to return to the Main Menu. This enables you to go back to choose again an option in the Main Menu or leave the system.
